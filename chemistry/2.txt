In this section, we will study about the elements in P-block and their properties. P block elements are shiny and usually a good conductor of electricity and heat as they have a tendency to lose an electron. You will find some amazing properties of elements in a P-block element like gallium. It’s a metal that can melt in the palm of your hand. Silicon is also one of the most important metalloids of the p-block group as it is an important component of glass.

Do you know what P-block elements are?

P-block elements

P block elements are nothing but the element in which the last electron enters the outermost p-subshell. P block elements consist of boron family, nitrogen family, oxygen family, fluorine family and lastly the family of noble gases that are neon family. P block starts from the group and goes till 18th group in the periodic table.

You must have seen that coal is used in villages to cook food. It is nothing but a P-block element i.e. carbon. Diamonds are used for making beautiful ornaments are also made up of carbon. Aluminium foil made up of aluminum is also made up of p block element.

The general electronic configuration of p-block elements is ns2np1-6(except He).Whereas the inner core electronic configuration may differ. Just because of this difference the inner core, there are changes in both physical and chemical properties of the elements.

The oxidation state of elements in p – block is maximum when it is equal to a total number of valence electrons i.e. the sum of S and P electrons. One of the most interesting facts about the p-block elements is that it contains both non-metals and metalloids.

The first member of the p block elements differ with other elements in two major respects:

First is the size and each and every property which depend upon size. The second difference applies only to the p-block element which arises from the effects of d-orbitals in the valence shell of heavier elements.
