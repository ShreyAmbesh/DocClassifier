What is Electromagnetic Induction?
When an induced current is produced because of voltage production (electromotive force) due to a changing magnetic field, it is called Electromagnetic Induction. This either happens when a conductor is placed in a moving magnetic field (when using ac power source) or when a conductor is constantly moving in a stationary magnetic field.

This phenomenon was discovered by Michael Faraday. He arranged a conducting wire as per the setup given below, attached to a device to measure the voltage across the circuit. When a bar magnet was moved through the coiling, the voltage detector measure a voltage in the circuit.

Electromagnetic Induction

Through his experiments he discovered that there are certain factors that influence this voltage production. They are

1. Number of Coils: The induced voltage is directly proportional to the number of turns/coils of the wire. Greater the number of turns, greater is voltage produced

2. Changing Magnetic Field: Changing magnetic field affects the induced voltage. This can be done by either moving the magnetic field around the conductor or moving the conductor in the magnetic field.

Importance of Electromagnetic Induction:
Based on his experiments we now have Faraday’s law according to which the amount of voltage induced in a coil is proportional to the number of turns of the coil and the rate of changing magnetic field.

Mathematically, the induced voltage can be given by the following relation.

is the induced voltage (in volts)
is the number of turns in the coil
is the magnetic flux – amount of magnetic field at a surface (in Webers)
is the time (in seconds)

The significance of this discovery is a way of producing electrical energy in a circuit by using magnetic fields and not just batteries anymore. Useful everyday machines like motors, generators and transformers work on the principle of electromagnetic induction.
